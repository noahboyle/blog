# HELLO MONDAY - MAGRITTE

An amazing online exhibit created by Hello Monday. I love the custom, trippy transitions, the great use of avant-garde music, and the experiential quality of the whole site. It is very inventive and engaging, it brought me into a world of an artist I had never heard of and kept me there for a while. I have no idea how it was built but this project is especially what cemented my interest in the firm Hello Monday.
